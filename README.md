After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. Since I am a CS-grad so I am already familiar with Web dev yet to polish my skills,I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned full-stack web development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB/Firebase. I am also familiar with TypeScript at a beginner level. I am always looking to learn new technologies.
